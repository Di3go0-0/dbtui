# Changelog

## v0.3.0 — 2026-04-07

### Added

#### Configurable keybindings
- **`keybindings.toml`** — full configurable keybinding system. Default config lives in `src/keybindings/defaults.rs`; user overrides go in `~/.config/dbtui/keybindings.toml` (XDG-style). Per-action bindings, multiple keys per action, vim-style notation (`<C-h>`, `<leader>`).
- **CLI flags** — `dbtui --print-keybindings` dumps the current resolved bindings as TOML to stdout; `dbtui --dump-keybindings` writes the defaults to the config path so you can start from a working file.
- **Every handler dispatches via `bindings.matches(Context::X, "action", &key)`** — `events/mod.rs` (global), `leader.rs` (root + every sub-menu), `sidebar.rs`, `scripts.rs`, `grid.rs`, `oil.rs`, and the menu overlays. Stateful chords (`dd`, `yy`) re-check bindings on the second press, so rebinding the first key also rebinds the chord completion.
- **Help surfaces read the live config** — `widgets/help.rs` and the leader popup (`layout/overlays.rs::render_leader_help`) resolve every label via `state.bindings.primary_key(...)`, so the `?` screen and the leader hint always reflect the user's actual keys.
- **`KEYBINDINGS.md`** — user-facing documentation: every context, every action, override examples, and the full default table.

#### SQL completion
- **`TABLE(pkg.fn()) tb` pseudo-column completion** — typing `tb.<cursor>` after a `FROM TABLE(schema.pkg.func(...)) tb` ref now suggests the attributes of the Oracle object type the function returns. Resolved on demand by walking `ALL_ARGUMENTS` (position=0, data_level=1) → `ALL_TYPE_ATTRS`, cached per `(schema, package, function)` in the `MetadataIndex`. New `get_function_return_columns` adapter method (Oracle implements it; MySQL/PG return `Ok(vec![])`).
- **Package member completion** — `schema.pkg.<cursor>` and `pkg.<cursor>` now suggest the functions and procedures inside the package. The first time the user touches an unloaded package, completion fires `LoadPackageMembers` through the existing async pipeline and re-fires the popup when the load returns; no need to expand the package in the explorer first. Accepting a Package suggestion appends `.` so the next suggestion can chain.
- **User-defined functions in FROM** — Oracle's top-level functions are suggested as candidates in FROM, alongside tables and views.
- **Oracle pseudo-table functions** — `TABLE(...)`, `THE(...)`, `XMLTABLE(...)`, `JSON_TABLE(...)` are surfaced in FROM-context completion.
- **Live diagnostics in Insert mode** — sqlparser/semantic checks now re-run while typing in Insert mode with a 150ms throttle, instead of only on Insert→Normal transition.
- **`Ctrl+Space` forced completion** — properly forwards `cache_action` so the on-demand cache load fires even on a manually triggered popup.

#### Explorer / Oil
- **Inline create / rename** for groups and connections — oil-style buffer entry replacing the old modal flow. `i`/`o` on a collapsed group starts an inline create; `r` on a connection starts an inline rename.
- **`r` is context-aware** — on a category, reload the children of that category; on a schema, reload every expanded category beneath it; on a leaf, open the rename modal.
- **`F` filter inside oil**, layered Esc handling so an inner rename/search input is cancelled before oil itself closes, and `Ctrl+S` opens the selected object in a new vertical group.
- **Topbar tracks the sidebar cursor too** — connection name / DB type now reflect either the active tab's connection or the connection the sidebar cursor is hovering, whichever is more relevant.

#### Other
- **`-` toggles the floating oil navigator** (was `<leader>+E`). Matches oil.nvim muscle memory; pressing `-` again closes it. Configurable via `[global] toggle_oil_navigator`.

### Fixed
- **PL/SQL diagnostic false positive** — blank lines inside a `DECLARE .. BEGIN .. END;` block were splitting the block in two, so the second half (e.g. a bare `SCHEMA.PKG.PROC(...)` call) reached sqlparser as a stray statement and tripped "Expected an SQL statement". The block splitter now tracks BEGIN/END nesting (skipping the control-flow enders `END IF/LOOP/CASE/WHILE/FOR`) and treats blanks inside the span as non-blank.
- **Keybinding case-sensitivity** — `KeyBinding::matches` was case-folding Char comparisons, so the binding `Char('e')` matched a runtime event of `Char('E')`. Pressing `<leader>E` was firing `toggle_sidebar` ("e") instead of `toggle_oil_navigator` ("E"). Char comparisons are now case-sensitive; the SHIFT modifier is still tolerated for terminals that don't report it on uppercase chars.
- **`<leader>f` / `<leader>q` submenu popups** — `check_leader_help_timeout` was only flagging `help_visible` for `b/w/s/leader_pending`. Adding `f_pending` and `q_pending` so the submenu popup actually appears.
- **`Ctrl+S` in oil** — the global Ctrl+S intercept (save script / compile to DB) was firing before oil's handler when the user opened the navigator from a script tab, so the open-in-split shortcut never triggered. Gated the intercept on `state.oil.is_none()`.
- **Visual yank from the header row** — pressing `v` on the header and then `j` was losing the header in the final yank. Tracked via a new `grid_anchor_on_header` flag; `grid_yank` (now extracted into the pure `build_yank_text` for unit testing) prepends the column names — scoped to the selected column range — whenever the flag is set. The grid renderer also paints the header cells inside the selected column range so the user can see the header is part of the selection.
- **Export / Import dialog backgrounds** — both dialogs were rendering their `Block` directly on the editor without clearing the cells underneath, so the script/grid bled through. They now match every other modal: `Clear` + `bg(theme.dialog_bg)`.
- **`CREATE OR REPLACE TYPE` (Oracle)** — sqlparser refuses to parse it; `is_unsupported_plsql_ddl` now skips linting the family of PL/SQL DDL forms the parser can't handle, so the bogus "Expected TABLE or VIEW" error no longer fires.
- **Cursor jump on group/connection delete** — sidebar cursor stayed near the deletion site instead of jumping back to row 0.
- **Per-tab streaming spinner** — `AppMessage::Error` now clears `streaming_since` so a failed DDL fetch stops spinning forever.
- **DBMS_METADATA "ORA-31603" friendly error** — the Oracle adapter surfaces a clearer message when `DBMS_METADATA` can't read DDL for the current user.
- **`TABLE(...)` alias capture** — the tokenizer now skips the parenthesised call before scanning for the alias, so `FROM TABLE(pkg.fn()) tb` actually captures `tb`.
- **`scripts pending-d/y` chord** — both presses of `dd`/`yy` go through `bindings.matches`, so users who rebind the first key also rebind the second.

### Changed
- **`-` replaces `<leader>+E`** for the floating navigator (see Added).
- **Numeric panel jumps removed** — `1`/`2`/`3`/`4` (with or without Ctrl) collided with vim count prefixes (`d3j`); spatial nav via `Ctrl+h/j/k/l` covers the same use case.
- **Bracket nav cycles result tabs on scripts** — `[`/`]` cycles the result tabs on script tabs (was sub-views), unifying with the sub-view bracket convention on table tabs.
- **`r` in the grid refreshes table data** — was inert/inconsistent. `{`/`}` no longer cycle result tabs (use `[`/`]`).
- **Help & leader popup labels** read from `state.bindings.primary_key(...)` instead of hardcoded strings.

---

## v0.2.3 — 2026-04-07

### Added
- **Oil floating navigator** — `<leader>+E` toggles a centered transparent dual-pane modal (Explorer + Scripts) with rounded borders, inspired by oil.nvim/telescope.nvim. Auto-closes when opening a tab. `Ctrl+h/l` switches panes.
- **Sidebar toggle** — `<leader>+e` shows/hides the sidebar+scripts panel. Default: hidden on startup, full-width editor.
- **Tab groups (vertical split)** — `<leader>+|` creates a vertical split (max 2 groups). Each group has its own tab bar and active tab. `Tab`/`S-Tab` cycle within the focused group only.
  - `<leader>+m` moves the active tab to the other group
  - `<leader>+w+d` closes the focused group: kills the active tab and merges the rest into the surviving group; falls back to close-tab when no split
  - `Ctrl+h`/`Ctrl+l` navigate between groups (within-tab Results↔QueryView takes priority)
  - Each group is independent — tabs are cloned with new TabIds so editing/results stay separate
  - `Ctrl+S` from oil opens the selected object in a new vertical group
- **Navigable Properties view** — properties now render in the data grid with `j/k/h/l`, visual mode (`v`), and copy (`y`)
- **Selectable header row** — `k` from the first data row moves the cursor onto the column names; `g` jumps to header, `G` to last row; `y` on header copies column names
- **`<leader>+f` file sub-menu** — `<leader>+f+e` export connections, `<leader>+f+i` import connections (moved from `<leader>+e`/`<leader>+i`)
- **`<leader>+q+q` quit** — `q` no longer quits from the sidebar; quitting now goes through `<leader>+q+q` with unsaved-changes confirmation
- **Dynamic topbar** — connection name, DB type, schema, and status now reflect the active tab's connection (was hardcoded to the first connection)
- **Diagnostic severity & colors** — errors (red), warnings (yellow), info (blue), hints (dim) with distinct underline colors and status bar prefixes (`[error]`, `[warning]`, `[lint]`)
- **Diagnostic gutter signs** — `✘` (error) and `⚠` (warning) rendered left of line numbers via vimltui `DiagnosticSign`; separate from diff signs (`│`/`▲`/`▼`) on the right
- **Diagnostic navigation** — `Ctrl+]` / `Ctrl+[` next/previous error (wraps around), syncs with diagnostic list cursor
- **Diagnostic tooltip** — `K` in Normal mode shows floating popup with full message and source label; any key dismisses
- **Diagnostic list panel** — `Spc-x` toggles bottom panel listing all diagnostics with `✘`/`⚠` icons, `row:col`, and messages; `j`/`k` navigate, `Enter` jumps to location
- **"Did you mean?" suggestions** — unknown tables/schemas fuzzy-matched against MetadataIndex: `Unknown table 'oder' — did you mean 'orders'?`
- **Column qualifier validation** — `ord.column` now errors when alias `ord` doesn't exist in scope (e.g., table aliased as `or2`)

### Fixed
- **Per-connection state isolation** — three bugs caused cross-connection contamination with multiple open connections:
  - Sidebar lock icons used a global `current_schema` instead of per-connection metadata indexes
  - Warm-up loading resolved the adapter from sidebar cursor instead of by connection name
  - `insert_leaves` matched the first Category by `(schema, kind)` regardless of connection, inserting objects under the wrong connection when both had overlapping schema names
- **Oracle TIMESTAMP / DATE display** — replaced raw String decode with `oracle_col_to_string` handling `Timestamp` (with nanoseconds), `IntervalDS/YM`, RAW/BLOB as hex
- **MySQL TIMESTAMP / DATETIME display** — type-aware decoder: chrono first for date types with binary protocol byte fallback, plus `DECIMAL`, `JSON`, `BIT`, `BLOB`/`BINARY` as hex, `YEAR`
- **PostgreSQL types** — added `JSON`/`JSONB` via serde_json and `INTERVAL` formatting (months/days/HH:MM:SS)
- **Editor focus after closing last result tab** — `sub_focus` now resets to `Editor` so you can type immediately without pressing Escape
- **Data grid columns** — last column no longer stretches to fill the row; every column takes only the width it needs
- **`:q` / `:q!` in editor** — closes the tab instead of quitting the app
- **Auto-alias avoids SQL reserved words** — `orders` no longer generates `or` (reserved); 70+ reserved words checked
- **Gutter width calculation** — completion popup, diagnostic underlines, and hover tooltip all account for diagnostic column width (+2 chars)
- **Shared tokenization** — lint passes reuse tokens from a single `tokenize_sql()` call instead of 3 separate ones

### Changed
- **Keybinding overhaul**
  - `]` / `[` direct sub-view switching (no pending bracket state)
  - `Ctrl+]` / `Ctrl+[` for diagnostic navigation (was `]d` / `[d`)
  - `<leader>+E` (Shift+E) opens oil navigator
  - `<leader>+|` creates vertical split
  - `<leader>+m` moves tab between groups
  - `<leader>+b+d` closes the active tab — also closes a result tab when `sub_focus` is on Results
  - `<leader>+w+d` closes the focused tab group (was close result tab)
  - `<leader>+f+e` / `<leader>+f+i` for export/import
  - `<leader>+q+q` to quit
  - Old `<leader>+e` (export) and `<leader>+i` (import) removed
- **Transparent modals** — `dialog_bg` set to `Color::Reset` across all 6 themes; help, leader popup, and connection/import/export dialogs now show the terminal wallpaper through the modal background
- **Default startup focus** — `Focus::TabContent` (was Sidebar) since the sidebar is hidden by default
- **`sub_focus` is global** — when split is active, only the focused group highlights its editor/results panel; the unfocused group renders all panels as inactive
- **vimltui** — bumped to 0.1.9 (from crates.io); uses new `DiagnosticSign` enum (left of number) separate from `GutterSign` (right of number)
- **Diagnostic pipeline** — `check_local()` shares tokenization across lint passes via `check_lint_with_tokens()`

---

## v0.2.2 — 2026-04-06

### Added
- **R2: AppState decomposition** — 51 flat fields split into 6 sub-structs: `ConnectionState`, `SidebarState`, `DialogState`, `LeaderState`, `ScriptsState`, `EngineState` (15 root fields remaining)
- **UPDATE/DELETE completion** — new `AfterUpdateTable`, `AfterDeleteTable` cursor contexts with SET/WHERE keyword suggestions and on-demand column loading for SET clause
- **Paren-depth tracking** in backward keyword scanner — `ORDER BY` inside `OVER()` no longer contaminates outer SELECT/FROM context
- **Window function completion** — `OVER`, `PARTITION BY`, `ORDER BY` inside `OVER()` correctly scoped with columns, aliases, and keywords
- **Auto-alias on table accept** — accepting a table in FROM/JOIN appends a 2-3 char alias derived from the name (`orders` → `or`, `customer_orders` → `co`), conflict-aware with existing aliases
- **130+ dialect-specific functions** — Oracle (53), PostgreSQL (44), MySQL (38): window functions (`LEAD`, `LAG`, `FIRST_VALUE`...), date (`DATE_TRUNC`, `ADD_MONTHS`...), JSON, regex, string, aggregate
- **Toggle comment** — `gcc` toggles `--` on current line (Normal), `gc` toggles block comment on selection (Visual); works in scripts, packages, functions, procedures
- **Auto-pair brackets** — typing `(`, `[`, `{`, `'` auto-inserts the closing pair with cursor between
- **Smart modified detection** — hash-based content comparison clears `(*)` indicator when edits revert to saved state (via undo or manual re-edit)
- **Clipboard: OSC 52** — universal terminal clipboard support via escape sequence (works in kitty, alacritty, WezTerm, tmux, SSH)
- **Confirm delete connection** — `y/n` dialog before removing a connection (from sidebar `dd` or connection menu)
- **Leader+s SQL snippets** — `+u` UPDATE, `+d` DELETE, `+p` CALL/EXEC procedure, `+f` SELECT function, `+t` CREATE TABLE — all dialect-aware (Oracle/MySQL/PG) with `$` cursor positioning
- **Star completion** — completion triggers after `*` in SELECT for column replacement
- **rows_affected feedback** — all 3 drivers report affected row count: `"Statement executed successfully (N row(s) affected)"`

### Fixed
- **Query scope** — `query_block_at_cursor` rewritten; blank lines at buffer start no longer break SQL block detection
- **DECIMAL display in MySQL** — raw byte decode via `sqlx::Decode` bypasses type-checking; values like `DECIMAL`, `NUMERIC` now display correctly instead of NULL
- **DATETIME/DATE/TIME display** — `chrono` integration for MySQL and PostgreSQL; dates render as `2024-02-10 16:20:00`
- **DML persistence** — explicit `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` transactions in MySQL and PostgreSQL `execute`/`execute_streaming`
- **Completion popup z-index** — renders above diagnostic underlines instead of behind
- **Script save in collections** — uses `file_path` (with collection prefix) instead of display name; saves to correct subdirectory
- **Diagnostic false positives** — skip semantic pass when `MetadataIndex` has no schemas loaded

### Changed
- **Scripts panel rename** — `r` instead of `cw`; insert position now within current collection instead of at end
- **Remove `n` shortcut** for new script — use `i` in scripts panel only
- **Keyword suggestions expanded** — `OVER`, `PARTITION`, `BY`, `ASC`, `DESC`, `AS`, `DISTINCT` added to Predicate and OrderGroupBy contexts
- **vimltui 0.1.8** — adds `ToggleComment` / `ToggleBlockComment` editor actions, `pending_gc` state

---

## v0.2.1 — 2026-04-05

### Added
- **SQL Engine** (`src/sql_engine/`) — new semantic analysis layer between core and UI:
  - `SqlDialect` trait encapsulating Oracle/PostgreSQL/MySQL differences (identifier casing, schema support, builtin functions, reserved words)
  - `MetadataIndex` — central indexed store replacing scattered tree walking for completion and diagnostics
  - `SemanticAnalyzer` — dual strategy: sqlparser AST parsing + token-based fallback for incomplete SQL and Oracle PL/SQL
  - `CompletionProvider` — fzf-inspired fuzzy matching (Exact > Prefix > Contains > Fuzzy) with ranked scoring and FK-aware JOIN suggestions
  - `DiagnosticProvider` — 3-pass pipeline: syntax (sqlparser per dialect), semantic (unknown table/schema detection), lint rules (`SELECT *`, `DELETE` without `WHERE`, `JOIN` without `ON`)
  - `DiagnosticSet` with source-based updates (syntax/semantic/lint/server can update independently)
  - 60 unit tests covering all engine components
- **Foreign key queries** — `get_foreign_keys()` implemented for Oracle (`ALL_CONSTRAINTS`), PostgreSQL (`information_schema`), MySQL (`KEY_COLUMN_USAGE`)
- **Server-side SQL validation** — `compile_check()` implemented for Oracle (execute + `USER_ERRORS`), PostgreSQL (`PREPARE`/`DEALLOCATE` in rollback transaction), MySQL (`PREPARE`/`DEALLOCATE`)
- **On-demand schema object loading** — typing `schema.` in the editor triggers lazy loading of tables/views for that schema (fixes completion for schemas not yet expanded in sidebar)
- **Encrypted export/import** (`.dbx` format):
  - Single encrypted file containing connections, scripts, groups, filters, script-connection mappings, bind variables
  - ChaCha20Poly1305 + Argon2 encryption with user-chosen password
  - Option to include or exclude credentials (passwords)
  - `manifest.json` with version, timestamp, counts for forward compatibility
  - `leader+e` for export, `leader+i` for import
  - Path field with Tab-completion (filesystem autocomplete, cycles on repeated Tab)
  - Paste support in path and password fields
  - "Show password" toggle in both export and import dialogs
  - Merge strategy on import: skip existing connections/scripts by name
- **PL/SQL keyword coverage** — ~100 new keywords for highlighter and completion:
  - Structure: `RECORD`, `PIPELINED`, `PIPE ROW`, `SUBTYPE`, `VARRAY`, `OBJECT`
  - Control flow: `ELSIF`, `CONTINUE`, `GOTO`, `EXIT`
  - Data types: `NUMBER`, `VARCHAR2`, `CLOB`, `BOOLEAN`, `PLS_INTEGER`, `BINARY_INTEGER`, `SYS_REFCURSOR`, etc.
  - DDL: `CONSTRAINT`, `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN`, `REFERENCES`, `UNIQUE`, `CASCADE`
  - Analytic: `OVER`, `PARTITION BY`, `UNBOUNDED`, `PRECEDING`, `FOLLOWING`
  - Oracle modifiers: `DETERMINISTIC`, `RESULT_CACHE`, `AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION`, `PARALLEL_ENABLE`
  - Oracle functions: `INITCAP`, `LTRIM`, `RTRIM`, `TRANSLATE`, `CONCAT`, `MOD`, `ABS`, `CEIL`, `FLOOR`, `ADD_MONTHS`, `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`

### Fixed
- **Per-connection MetadataIndex** — each connection now has its own metadata index; switching between scripts connected to different databases (e.g., Oracle and MySQL) shows the correct tables/views for each
- **Auto-load schemas on script connection** — assigning a connection to a script via `leader+c` now triggers automatic schema/table loading if metadata wasn't loaded yet (no need to expand sidebar first)
- **Streaming query cancellation** — closing a result tab or tab now aborts the streaming task (both outer relay and inner DB query), preventing background resource consumption
- **Filter persistence on connection rename** — object filter keys are now migrated when renaming a connection (fixes lost filters after rename)
- **PL/SQL completion context** — PL/SQL block keywords (`IF`, `ELSIF`, `THEN`, `BEGIN`, `LOOP`, etc.) now act as context boundaries, preventing stale `SELECT`/`FROM` context from leaking into PL/SQL code
- **CASE parentheses** — `CASE` removed from function list (no longer inserts `()` on accept)
- **NOT EXISTS parentheses** — added to keywords that auto-insert `()`

### Changed
- Completion engine replaced: old heuristic `starts_with` matching → new fuzzy matching with scoring tiers
- Diagnostics engine replaced: old single-pass → new 3-pass pipeline (syntax + semantic + lint)
- Tokenizer migrated from `src/ui/sql_tokens.rs` to `src/sql_engine/tokenizer.rs` (UI module re-exports)
- Legacy `ui/completion.rs` reduced from 1,169 to 148 lines (only UI types kept)
- Legacy `ui/diagnostics.rs` reduced from 386 to 11 lines (only Diagnostic struct kept)

### Refactored
- **events.rs** (4,576 lines) → 7 modules: `editor`, `grid`, `leader`, `overlays`, `scripts`, `sidebar`, `mod`
- **app.rs** (4,534 lines) → 5 modules: `messages`, `spawns`, `connections`, `persistence`, `mod`
- **layout.rs** (2,392 lines) ��� 3 modules: `overlays`, `tabs`, `mod`
- Metadata loading handlers consolidated via generic `handle_objects_loaded()`
- Loading state resets consolidated via `finish_loading()` helper (~20 occurrences)

---

## v0.2.0 — 2026-04-05

### Added
- **DB-specific tree categories** — each database shows only its relevant object types:
  - Oracle: Tables, Views, Materialized Views, Indexes, Sequences, Types, Triggers, Packages, Procedures, Functions
  - MySQL: Tables, Views, Indexes, Triggers, Events, Procedures, Functions (no Packages)
  - PostgreSQL: Tables, Views, Materialized Views, Indexes, Sequences, Triggers, Procedures, Functions
- **Table DDL view** — `}` to switch to DDL sub-view on any table/view tab. PostgreSQL reconstructs from `information_schema`, MySQL uses `SHOW CREATE TABLE`, Oracle uses `DBMS_METADATA.GET_DDL` (read via `DBMS_LOB.SUBSTR` chunks to avoid ODPI-C CLOB crashes)
- **Type inspector** (Oracle) — open a TYPE to see four sub-views: Attributes (#, Name, Type, Type Mod, Length), Methods (Name, Method Type, Result, Final, Instantiable), Declaration, Body
- **Trigger inspector** (Oracle) — open a TRIGGER to see Columns (Name, Usage) and Declaration sub-views
- **Index/Sequence/Event source** — open any index, sequence, or event to view its DDL declaration
- **Materialized view support** — opens like a table (Data, Properties, DDL); shows valid/invalid status and privilege icons in Oracle
- **Oil-style quick actions on DB objects**:
  - `dd` on table/view/package → confirmation modal (red border) → executes `DROP`
  - `r` on table/view/connection → rename modal (yellow border, input field) → executes `ALTER TABLE RENAME TO` or renames connection
  - `o`/`i` on Tables/Views/Packages category → opens new script with CREATE template (dialect-aware)
- **Oil-style connection management**:
  - `yy` on connection → yank; `p` → duplicate into current group (not source group)
  - `r` on connection → rename modal (updates all references: tabs, adapters, config)
  - `o`/`i` on connection/group → open new connection dialog
- **Tree navigation: `h`/`←` collapses parent** — pressing `h` on a child node navigates to the parent and collapses it (like Neovim file explorer)
- **Empty category indicator** — `(empty)` in italic/dim when a tree category has no items
- **Paste support** — `Ctrl+V` / terminal paste works in connection dialog fields, editor search (`/`), and command mode (`:`)
- **"Fetching data..." animation everywhere** — unified loading indicator with animated dots + elapsed timer in DDL, Declaration, Body, source code, type attributes, trigger columns. Single reusable `loading.rs` module
- **Error panel for compile errors** — package/function/procedure compilation failures show Error + SQL split pane (same as script query errors), auto-switches to the body/declaration where the error occurred
- **Error panel for DB actions** — DROP/RENAME failures show the Error + SQL split pane
- **Diff signs in editor gutter** (requires vimltui 0.1.6) — GitSigns-style indicators when editing packages, functions, procedures:
  - Green `│` + green line number = new line (Added)
  - Yellow `│` + yellow line number = changed line (Modified)
  - Red `▼`/`▲` = lines deleted below/above
  - LCS-based diff with string similarity pairing and trailing whitespace tolerance
  - Signs clear on successful compile (original content updated)
- **Compile confirmation modal** — `Ctrl+S` on packages/functions/procedures shows a yellow modal listing which parts have changes before compiling
- **`Ctrl+S` global shortcut** — saves scripts to disk, opens compile modal for source tabs; works from any editor mode
- **CREATE OR REPLACE prefix** — Oracle packages, functions, procedures load with full DDL prefix like DBeaver
- **Oracle `ALL_ERRORS` check** — after compiling PL/SQL, queries `ALL_ERRORS` to detect compilation errors (Oracle accepts invalid DDL silently)
- **Auto-refresh tree after DDL** — `CREATE`/`DROP`/`ALTER`/`RENAME` from scripts automatically reloads the relevant tree category
- **DDL/DML execution from scripts** — `CREATE`, `DROP`, `ALTER`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` statements now execute correctly (uses `execute()` instead of `query()` in all three drivers)
- **Cursor shape for Replace mode** — `r` shows underline cursor while waiting for replacement char; `R` shows underline in continuous Replace mode

### Fixed
- **Modal overlays float over content** — Save Changes, Confirm Close, and all modals now use `ratatui::widgets::Clear` instead of blanking the entire screen
- **Oracle CLOB handling** — `DBMS_METADATA.GET_DDL` reads via `DBMS_LOB.SUBSTR` in 4000-char chunks, avoiding `DPI-1080`/`ORA-03135` crashes from direct CLOB `query_row_as`
- **PL/SQL diagnostics suppressed** — sqlparser-based diagnostics (underlines + status bar messages) disabled for Package/Function/Procedure/Type/Trigger tabs; prevents false "Expected TABLE or VIEW" errors
- **Number keys in editor** — `1`/`2`/`3`/`4` only jump to panels when NOT in an editor; in editor focus, they pass to vimltui as count prefix for motions (`y3j`, `d2w`)
- **Compile error text wrapping** — error messages wrap at 40 chars in the error panel
- **Escape in error panes** — only returns to editor from Normal mode; Visual/Search mode Escape handled by vimltui first

### Performance
- **Oracle dual connections** — metadata operations (`meta_conn`) run on a separate connection from user queries (`conn`), eliminating mutex contention that caused ORA-03135 on concurrent operations
- **`USER_*` views for own schema** — Oracle metadata queries use `USER_INDEXES`, `USER_SEQUENCES`, `USER_TYPES`, `USER_TRIGGERS`, `USER_MVIEWS` etc. for the connected user's schema (no privilege checking overhead), falling back to `ALL_*` for foreign schemas
- **Lazy loading for new categories** — Materialized Views, Indexes, Sequences, Types, Triggers, Events load only when expanded; warm-up pre-loads only Tables, Views, Procedures, Functions, Packages

## v0.1.5 — 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Panel jump with number keys** — `1`/`2`/`3`/`4` (without Ctrl) jump to Explorer, Scripts, Editor, or Results panel in Normal mode. Ctrl+1/2/3/4 still works
- **Own schema highlight** — the connected user's schema shows `◉` in green with bold text; other schemas show `◇` in default color. Makes it easy to spot your schema in Oracle environments with many shared schemas
- **Dynamic version display** — statusbar version and `--version` CLI flag now read from `Cargo.toml` at compile time via `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")`, no more hardcoded strings
- **Inline table editing** — edit table data directly in the grid like DBeaver with Vim keybindings:
  - `i` on a cell to edit inline, `Escape`/`Enter` to confirm, `Tab` to move to next cell
  - `o` to insert a new row, `dd` to mark a row for deletion
  - `Ctrl+S` to save all pending changes (generates INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE SQL)
  - `u` to discard all pending changes
  - Color feedback: yellow = modified cell, green = new row, red = deleted row
  - Confirmation modal (yellow border) with change summary before saving
  - Error display split-pane (Error + SQL) identical to script query errors, navigable with `Ctrl+hjkl`
  - NULL cells clear on edit entry; empty input saves as NULL
  - Beam cursor in insert mode, block cursor in normal mode
  - Unsaved grid changes block app quit (navigates to unsaved tab)
  - Cursor position preserved on reload/save
  - Requires primary key for UPDATE/DELETE operations
- **Permission indicators** — lock icons show access level on shared schema objects (🔓 full, 🔒 read-only, ⚡ execute)
- **Progressive data loading** — queries stream results in 500-row batches; "Fetching data..." animation with elapsed timer
- **Row numbers** — `#` column in data grid for tables, views, and query results
- **Fixed column widths** — columns sized to content (max 40 chars) instead of expanding to fill space
- **Tab bar scroll** — auto-scrolls to active tab with yellow `◀ 3` / `2 ▶` overflow indicators

### Performance
- PostgreSQL streaming uses server-side cursors (transaction-wrapped) for immediate first-row delivery
- Oracle streams rows in batches via `spawn_blocking` with `blocking_send`
- MySQL uses sqlx `fetch()` stream with `TryStreamExt`

## v0.1.4 — 2026-04-04

### Added
- **Oil-style script collections** — scripts panel now uses vim keybindings mapped directly to filesystem operations. `i`/`o` to create (name ending in `/` creates a folder), `dd` to delete, `cw` to rename, `yy`/`p` to move scripts between collections. Collections are subdirectories in `~/.local/share/dbtui/scripts/`. Directories rendered with accent color and `▶`/`▼` expand icons
- **SQL syntax error diagnostics** — sqlparser-based validation detects misspelled keywords, missing clauses, and other syntax errors. Each query block is parsed independently with the correct dialect (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Generic for Oracle)
- **Bind variable syntax highlighting** — `:name` (Oracle/MySQL) and `$1`/`$name` (PostgreSQL) are highlighted with a distinct amber/gold color across all 6 themes
- **Ctrl+1/2/3/4 panel navigation** — jump directly to Explorer, Scripts, Editor, or Results panel. Only active in Normal mode

### Fixed
- **`cargo install dbtui` broken from crates.io** — upgraded ratatui to 0.30, crossterm to 0.29, unicode-width to 0.2, and vimltui to 0.1.5. Without a lockfile, the previous dependency ranges caused two incompatible ratatui versions to be resolved, producing type mismatches at compile time
- **Diagnostics/completion used wrong connection** — now uses the script's assigned connection instead of the global sidebar connection. Metadata is scoped to the correct Connection node in the tree
- **Diagnostics false positives on aliases** — `FROM users u` no longer marks `u` as "unknown table". Aliases (both `AS` and implicit) are extracted and excluded from validation
- **Diagnostics not refreshing on connection change** — re-runs immediately when switching a script's connection
- **Default group reappearing after deletion** — "Default" group is now persisted like any other group; only auto-created as fallback when no groups exist and connections need one
- Replaced deprecated `frame.size()` calls with `frame.area()`

## v0.1.3 — 2026-04-04

### Added
- **Connection groups** — Organize connections in collapsible groups in the sidebar. Context menu (`m` on group) to rename, delete, or create groups. Group field in connection dialog (`Ctrl+G` to cycle). Empty groups persist across restarts via `groups.json`. Groups start collapsed on launch
- **Query elapsed time** — Result tabs show execution time (e.g. `Results (42) 128ms`); status bar shows time on query completion
- **Leader snippets menu** (`<leader>s`) — SQL template shortcuts; `<leader>s s` inserts a `SELECT * FROM` template at cursor and enters Insert mode
- **Auto-correct keyword case** — Typing `select` + Space auto-corrects to `SELECT`; same for all SQL keywords and functions. Table names corrected to match DB metadata case
- **Auto-insert parentheses** — Accepting a function (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `UPPER`, etc.) or `IN`/`EXISTS` from completion inserts `()` with cursor between parens

### Fixed
- Completion context detection: typing "or" after `FROM` no longer triggers `Predicate` context (was matching `OR` keyword instead of continuing `TableRef`)
- `WHERE` now appears in completion suggestions from `ON`/predicate context
- `JOIN`/`OUTER` suggested after `LEFT`/`RIGHT`/etc. in `TableRef` context
- Keywords no longer vanish from completion when prefix matches exactly (e.g. typing "IN" kept showing "IN")
- Diagnostic underline panic when editor lines change (e.g. after inserting snippet template)
- Tree drain operations use depth-based traversal instead of next-connection scan (supports nested group hierarchy)

## v0.1.2 — 2026-04-03

### Added
- **Context-aware SQL completion (CMP)** — Suggests the right thing at the right place:
  - Tables/views after `FROM`/`JOIN`, columns after `SELECT`/`WHERE`
  - Oracle `SCHEMA.OBJECT` hierarchy, `alias.column` resolution
  - Dialect-aware: Oracle/PostgreSQL with schemas, MySQL direct
  - Ctrl+Space (open), Ctrl+N/P (navigate), Ctrl+Y or Enter (accept)
  - Auto-trigger while typing, max 4 visible items
  - Query block scoping (blank line separation)
- **SQL diagnostics (LCP)** — Red underline on invalid table/view references, message in status bar
- **Bind variables prompt** — Modal to fill `:variableName` parameters before execution, values persisted across sessions
- **Metadata warm-up** — Tables/views auto-load on connect (no manual tree expansion needed for CMP)
- **Column cache** — On-demand column loading for `alias.` completion
- **Per-tab connections** — Each tab tracks its own connection, shown as `[conn_name]` in tab bar
- **Auto-connect on script open** — Scripts reconnect to their saved connection automatically
- **"Loading context..." indicator** — Status bar shows loading state during auto-connect
- **Unsaved changes modal** — Lists all unsaved files with quit/cancel options
- **Shared SQL tokenizer** — `sql_tokens` module used by both CMP and diagnostics

### Fixed
- Editor command mode (`:`) and search mode (`/`) no longer intercepted by global keys
- Leader key works in Visual mode (query execution with visual selection)
- Script connection preserved when opening (was lost on tab creation)
- Query errors now show real editor line number instead of "line 1"
- Diagnostic underlines stay within editor area in split view
- Completion popup floats above results panel

### Performance
- Prioritized schema loading: user's schema loads first, others sequentially
- Batch tree node insertion with `splice()` instead of O(n²) individual inserts
- `visible_tree()` uses reusable buffer instead of per-node `format!()` allocations
- Completion clones only query block lines, not entire editor buffer
- Diagnostics only run on Insert→Normal transition, not every keystroke

## v0.1.1 — 2026-04-03

### Changed
- **Vim editor powered by [vimltui](https://crates.io/crates/vimltui)** — extracted vim module as a reusable crate
- Generic `EditorAction` (no app-specific variants)
- `SyntaxHighlighter` trait with SQL highlighter extracted to separate module
- Leader key handling moved to app layer

### Added
- `f`/`F`/`t`/`T` character find motions
- `r` replace char, `s` substitute
- Auto-indent on `o`/`O`
- Search match highlighting (yellow for all matches, orange for current)
- Escape clears search highlights
